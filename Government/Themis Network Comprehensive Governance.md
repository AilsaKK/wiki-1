### Themis Network comprehensive governance

Themis Network, a comprehensive governance mechanism, is based on the governance mechanism involving all network users. Each user voting (referendum) has a corresponding specific "proposal", which is a transaction to be executed. However, the execution of such a transaction is not by verifying the signature, but the verification of the referendum result. There are several types of user participation in governance: foundations, committees, DSO, DAO, and general accounts. The proposals are also divided into the following categories: the proposals put forward by foundations, the emergency referendum proposals jointly put forward by foundations, committees, DSO and DAO based on combined consideration, and the public proposals won by public  votes. All users can vote "yes" or "no" during the referendum on each proposal by pledging their voting power. At the end of the referendum, the rules will determine whether the proposal is approved or not. There can be at most one ongoing referendum at any time, except the case of one additional emergency referendum.
