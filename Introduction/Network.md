### Network

Thinkium takes unique design of a multi-layer multi-chain structure, which can theoretically achieve unlimited scalability and facilitate Internet level large-scale applications through the separation of subchains from the main chain, inheritance of child-chains from their parent-chain, intra-chain sharding, and cross-chain communications. Thinkiumâ€™s current TPS has reached 100,000+.

In Thinkium, various P2P networks are built  for consensus protocols on different chains or layers , while the integration of structural and non-structural P2P networks can facilitate efficiency improvement. Structural P2P networks can be used to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency, meanwhile transmissions via non-structural P2P networks can ensure system stability.
