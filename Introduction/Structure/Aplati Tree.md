### Aplati tree

Thinkium has designed a flat tree chain structure, named "Aplati Tree", which can be infinitely layered. In the theoretical model, the blockchain system corresponding to a non-leaf node X is a structured blockchain, which is responsible for maintaining the node set and block set associated with all children nodes of X. The blockchain system corresponding to a leaf node Y is the trading blockchain, on which all transaction data  are consented.

 

The entire tree is divided into two layers, the main-chain layer and the subchain layer. All the nodes are registered in the main-chain network, and assigned to their own subchain networks. Any two subchains are independent of each other. The main chain manages the logical structure of the chain, and can allow the physically unrelated subchains to logically form a parent-child relationship and share related business. Both the main-chain and subchains can act as a parent chain to create child-chains, and perform sharding. As a result, the cross-chain efficiency can be significantly improved.
