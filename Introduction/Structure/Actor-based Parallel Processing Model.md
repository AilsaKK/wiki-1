### Actor-based Parallel Processing Model

The Actor-based parallel processing model greatly improves the execution efficiency of tasks, enables Thinkium to carry large transactions more efficiently, supports the operation of complex applications with large numbers of users, and paves the foundation for the business projects of blockchain, which were originally limited by technical maturity.

 

The Actor model allows complex logic to be implemented on a multi-chain system in an



asynchronous and lockless manner. In this model, transactions involving a set of accounts are divided into multiple steps in the form of messages. Each message is received by a unique main subject and executed by the corresponding chain. A transaction is completed only after all the messages have been executed.

 

There are two types of messages: external messages and relay messages. The external message is created by an account signed with a private key. Similar to messages in Ethereum, relay messages are generated by an account that executes the send  command during execution. The major difference is that the execution of the relay message is asynchronous in the Thinkium model, but synchronous in Ethereum. Therefore, messages in the Thinkium model support cross-chain propagation.
