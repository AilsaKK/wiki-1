### Dual-Coin Ecosystem

Thinkium supports the establishment of an independent industry ecology for subchains. Each subchain (and the chain tree based on it) can carry a second token besides the  base token, which can be used for business applications and market circulation within  the subchain system. The second token is fundamentally different from Ethereum's ERC20. First, it is not a data record in the ERC20 contract, but is recorded in each account, which can only be controlled by the private key of the account. Second, since Thinkium allows multiple chains with related businesses to be organized in a tree-structure, all the chains in the tree structure can inherit the settings of the second generation tokens made by the root chain. Such property allows the second generation tokens to be transferred among the chains with related businesses through cross-chain transactions, which fundamentally solves the cross-chain problem caused  by  the  intrinsic characteristics of ERC20 contract.
