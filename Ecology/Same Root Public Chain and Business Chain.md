### Same root Public chain and business chain

Because of the four-layer structure and consensus protocol system of Thinkium, it is convenient for Thinkium to derive the multi-layer multi-chain alliance-chain structure that requires licensing. This provides the foundation for Thinkium to bridge between the physical business world and the digital world, building the business world of Web 3.0. Utilizing the infrastructure of Thinkium, business entities can split their businesses according to their own needs, deploying confidential businesses on the more trustworthy “union-chain”, and other businesses on the permissionless "public-chain" for larger scale circulation. Such a businesses split could satisfy both the need for "confidentiality" and the need for "value circulation". Public-chain and alliance-chain can also be interchangeable according to business adjustment to achieve trustworthy fusion.
