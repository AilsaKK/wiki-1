### Single-chain

Thinkium provides the ability to build an independent single-chain, which can help early-stage small businesses adopt the Thinkium blockchain when they want to build an application chain customized for their own scenario at the minimum cost. With the development of the independent single-chain itself, it may need to interact with more chains. To benefit from a larger ecological space, these single chains can also connect to the main chain through the full-chain mapping.
