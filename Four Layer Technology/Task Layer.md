### Task layer

The first layer, "task layer", designs the master consensus algorithm, which mainly aims to achieve the overall consensus of the entire system. It is mainly responsible for dividing requests and nodes, and assigning different requests to specific committees for processing. All requests are first sent to the task layer, where they are split up and assigned to different committees for parallel processing. Since not all requests can be processed in parallel, they need to be partitioned according to their type. In addition, all active nodes are registered at the task layer. These nodes are randomly assigned to different committees to process different requests. It is essential to ensure that each committee is trustworthy, meaning that the percentage of malicious nodes within each committee should not exceed a certain threshold set by the system.
