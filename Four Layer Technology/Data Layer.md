### Data layer

The third layer, "data layer", designs the Siamese consensus algorithm, which mainly solves the consensus among multi-chains. The logs generated by each committee and  the requested data will be aggregated according to the specific coding method to form a single log. The goal of the system is to generate a consistent log for each node. Therefore, an aggregation algorithm is required to integrate all the logs generated by the nodes in the committee and achieve a unified log. Coding methods are also required to reduce the storage on each node. In addition, since nodes join and leave committees from time to time, the corresponding data from the data layer must be synchronized.
