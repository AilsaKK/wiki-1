## Introduction

A smart contract is a piece of the same code stored in the blockchain (each node). This code defines the rules of the contract. When the input meets the required conditions, the smart contract code in each node will be automatically executed independently and automatically cross check whether all the execution results are the same.



Thinkium's contract virtual machine is compatible with Ethereum's Evm.

The currently supported Solidity version is 0.7.

We will continue to update with the upgrade of mainstream Evm in the future.
