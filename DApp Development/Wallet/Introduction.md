## Introduction

Wallet is a key app for users to interact with the chain, and an important tool for user asset management.

After the user's mnemonic phrase and private key are created, they will be encrypted and stored on the user's mobile phone.

When a user initiates a transaction, the private key on the user's mobile phone is called to sign, and then the transaction is posted to the chain.

When creating a wallet, the user must record the mnemonic words on a physical device, such as a notepad, so as to prevent the loss of the mobile phone or other force majeure reasons, which may cause the wallet to be lost.

After the loss, as long as you still know the mnemonic, you can download the wallet app again, import the mnemonic, and retrieve the assets on the chain.
