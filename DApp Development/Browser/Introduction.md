## 简介

Blockchain browser is a tool that provides users with browsing and querying all information on the blockchain.

You can view all the Thinkium chain information, block information, transaction information, PoS information, etc.



Test browser address: [http://browser.thinkiumdev.net](http://browser.thinkiumdev.net)

Production browser address: [https://www.thinkiumscan.net](https://www.thinkiumscan.net)



In addition, for the majority of developers to develop applications on the chain, we also provide part of the interface of the blockchain browser.

We recommend developers to use SDK or Contract-Service to build their own blockchain browser services.

Because everyone uses the interface we provide, it may cause delays in network performance.
