## Introduction

Development on the blockchain is a complicated process.

At the beginning, many developers will be discouraged, because developers have to download the SDK, set up a compilation environment, sign transaction with private key locally, and perform a series of operations to interact with the chain, which is not easy to learn.

Therefore, we launched a one-stop packaged **Contract Service**. It is convenient for developers to develop Dapp quickly.

At present, the **Contract Service** has integrated, **public and private key generation, address generation, contract compilation, contract release, contract call, transaction signature, query transaction** and a series of on-chain and local blockchain methods.

The calling method adopts the simple Http Rest Api mode. It does not need to install any Solidity compilation environment locally, integrate any SDK, and it can easily interact with the chain. Make the development of Dapp more efficient.
